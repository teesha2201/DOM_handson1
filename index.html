    <h3>Q.8:What's the difference between window vs document?</h3>
    <p>Ans:
        Window: The window is at a root/top level at the JavaScript object hierarchy. 
        It  is a global/root object in JavaScript and it is the root object of the 
        Document object model(DOM).Because the first thing that gets loaded into the browser
        is the window and the properties related to that window are stored in the window object.
        Properties related to window objects are length, innerWidth, innerHeight, caches, etc.
        so after the window gets loaded then there's a document (HTML, PHP, or another document) loaded 
        inside that window, and the properties related to that document is stored in the document object. Properties related to document objects are title, URL, cookie, etc.

        Document: A document is an object inside the window object and we use
        a document object for manipulation inside the document.
